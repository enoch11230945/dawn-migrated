## 📦 Shipping Policy - Pre-order Section

Add this to your existing Shipping Policy page:

```html
<h3>Pre-order & Made-to-Order Items</h3>

<p>Some of our most popular pieces are currently available for <strong>Pre-order</strong>. These items are handcrafted with care and will be dispatched as soon as they arrive at our UK warehouse.</p>

<h4>Pre-order Dispatch Times</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Made-to-Order Items:</strong> 8-16 working days</li>
  <li><strong>Pre-order (Restocking):</strong> 10-15 working days</li>
</ul>

<p>You will receive an email notification with tracking information once your order is dispatched.</p>

<h4>Mixed Orders (Pre-order + In-Stock Items)</h4>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> If your order contains both "In Stock" and "Pre-order" items, we will ship the <em>entire order together</em> once all items are ready. This helps us reduce packaging waste and shipping costs.</p>

<p>If you need an in-stock item urgently, please place it as a <strong>separate order</strong>.</p>

<h4>Pre-order Cancellation</h4>
<p>Pre-orders can be cancelled for a <strong>full refund at any time BEFORE dispatch</strong>. Simply email us at <a href="mailto:hello@yourdomain.com">hello@yourdomain.com</a> with your order number.</p>

<p>If you change your mind about a pre-order, you can cancel and receive a <strong>full refund</strong> at any time before your order is dispatched. No questions asked!</p>

<h4>After Dispatch</h4>
<p>Once your pre-order has been dispatched, our standard <a href="/policies/refund-policy">return policy</a> applies. You have <strong>30 days</strong> from delivery to return unworn items for a full refund.</p>

<h4>How to Cancel a Pre-order</h4>
<ol>

## ❓ FAQ Page - Pre-order Questions

Add these to your FAQ page:

```html
<h3>Pre-order FAQs</h3>

<details>
  <summary><strong>What does "Pre-order" mean?</strong></summary>
  <p>Pre-order means the item is currently being restocked due to high demand. By placing a pre-order, you're reserving your item from the next batch. It's the best way to guarantee you get our most popular pieces!</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Why is my order taking longer than expected?</strong></summary>
  <p>If your order contains a pre-order item, your entire order will be shipped together once all items are ready. This typically takes 10-15 working days. You'll receive an email with tracking information as soon as your order ships.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Can I cancel my pre-order?</strong></summary>
  <p>Yes! You can cancel your pre-order for a full refund at any time before it's dispatched. Just email us at hello@yourdomain.com with your order number.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Will I be charged immediately for a pre-order?</strong></summary>
  <p>Yes, payment is taken at the time of ordering to secure your item. This also helps us plan our inventory better so we can bring you more of the pieces you love!</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>How will I know when my pre-order ships?</strong></summary>
  <p>You'll receive an email notification with full tracking details as soon as your order is dispatched. You can also check your order status anytime by logging into your account.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>I ordered an in-stock item and a pre-order item. Why haven't I received my in-stock item?</strong></summary>
  <p>To reduce packaging and shipping costs, we ship orders together. If your order contains both in-stock and pre-order items, we'll ship everything once the pre-order item is ready. If you need something urgently, please place it as a separate order next time!</p>
